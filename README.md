# ClimateHack 2023-24 University of Waterloo
This repo reproduces University of Waterloo's best performing model at ClimateHack 2023-24.

The notebook [waterloo-climatehack-walkthrough.ipynb](https://github.com/AreelKhan/waterloo-climatehack/blob/master/waterloo-climatehack-walkthrough.ipynb) has complete steps to reproduce the model, including steps to download the data, install dependencies, process data, and train a model.

To find all our experiments and code, see our original [repo](https://github.com/trevor-yu-087/climatehack.ai-2024), but beware, it is not documented, or well organized.
